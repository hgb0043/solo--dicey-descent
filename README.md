# solo--dicey-descent
  This code mimics the Wii Party minigame "Dicey Descent" that is completely based on luck. Players choose one side of a platform in the air, one side drops into a storm cloud while the other is harmless. Each player has two lives and there are three rounds. If two players are eliminated in the same round or have the same number of lives at the end of the game, they "roll off" or both roll six sided dice to see who gets the higher roll.
